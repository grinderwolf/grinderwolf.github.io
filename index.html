Well yeah thats weird, no this isn't the Slime World Manager API docs.

I randomly found this 404 page (The "original" grinderwolf renamed their github account) so I claimed it while I contacted the repo's to update their readme's

I will ofcourse release this github username / remove the pages when fixed, if I find the official javadocs i'll redirect to that.

If you want to contact me or get more info: niek(at)omg(dot)lol (Yeah email scrapers exist)

Greetings,
Niek
