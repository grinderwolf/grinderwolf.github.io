Well yeah thats weird, no this isn't the Slime World Manager API docs.<br>
<br>
I randomly found this 404 page (The "original" grinderwolf renamed their github account) so I claimed it while I contacted the repo's to update their readme's<br>
<br>
I will ofcourse release this github username / remove the pages when fixed, if I find the official javadocs i'll redirect to that.<br>
<br>
If you want to contact me or get more info: niek(at)omg(dot)lol (Yeah email scrapers exist)<br>
<br>
Greetings,<br>
Niek
